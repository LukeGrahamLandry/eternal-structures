## Features

**Doors and Keys**

each door and each key have a magic number in nbt and if they're the same magic number it'll open. 
in creative, right-clicking on a door with a key set's the key to work on that door, and then 
you can put it in a chest or loot at the nbt and put it in a loot table directly, etc.

Config to disable players opening/closing unlocked doors like normal ones.
